# Adafruit nRF52 Bootloader

This repository is a fork of the official Adafruit repository. My keyboards use external LED indicators, so I have made changes that allow them to display the bootloader status. The original code supports blinking only a single LED, whereas my version adds the ability to work with multiple indicators. If you have any questions unrelated to indicators, you should probably contact the creators of the original repository.

I do not describe some details that are not important to me. I am only interested in building UF2 bootloaders for nRF52 locally in Fedora or using GitHub Actions.

## My configs
* [nice_nano_LED](https://github.com/aroum/nRF52_Bootloader_custom_LED/tree/master/src/boards/nice_nano_LED)
* [nice_nano_RGB](https://github.com/aroum/nRF52_Bootloader_custom_LED/tree/master/src/boards/nice_nano_RGB)
* [nice_nano_LED](https://github.com/aroum/nRF52_Bootloader_custom_LED/tree/master/src/boards/kabarga)


## Burn & Upgrade with pre-built binaries
In most cases, you just need to connect the keyboard to your computer, double-press the MCU reset button, and copy the UF2 bootloader file to the newly appeared device.

## How to build

You should only continue if you are looking to develop bootloader for your own.
You must have have a J-Link available to "unbrick" your device.

## Creating a Configuration with Regular LEDs

To create your own bootloader variant for n!n, copy the `src/boards/nice_nano_LED` folder and rename it, for example, to `kabarga`. Then, edit the `board.h` file inside this folder.

Set `LED_PRIMARY_PIN` and `LED_SECONDARY_PIN` to the appropriate LED pins. Also, replace the following lines:

````
#ifndef _NICENANO_LED_H  
#define _NICENANO_LED_H  
````

with

```
#ifndef _KABARGA_H  
#define _KABARGA_H  
```
At the bottom of the file, you can change the device name.

Finally, build your bootloader using the command:

```BOARD=kabarga all```

The lighting parameters are configured in the `src/boards/boards.c` file, starting from line 365.

## Creating a Configuration with Addressable LEDs

To create your own bootloader variant for n!n, copy the `src/boards/nice_nano_RGB` folder and rename it, for example, to `kabarga_RGB`. Then, edit the `board.h` file inside this folder.

Set `LED_NEOPIXEL` and `LED_NEOPIXEL` to the appropriate LED pins. Set the `NEOPIXELS_NUMBER` parameter (number of LEDs) and `BOARD_RGB_BRIGHTNESS` (their brightness).

Also, replace the following lines:

```
#ifndef _NICENANO_RGB_H  
#define _NICENANO_RGB_H  
```

with

```
#ifndef _KABARGA_RGB_H  
#define _KABARGA_RGB_H  
```
At the bottom of the file, you can change the device name.

Finally, build your bootloader using the command:

```BOARD=kabarga-rgb all```

The lighting parameters are configured in the `src/boards/boards.c` file, starting from line 396.

## Building with GitHub Actions

* Fork this repository.
* Make the necessary changes.
* Commit and push.
* Wait for GitHub Actions to finish building your bootloader.

## Local Build

I use Fedora, but the commands will be similar on other distributions.

### Prerequisites

```
sudo dnf install python3-pip gcc-arm-none-eabi make arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs git --skip-unavailable    
pip3 install --user adafruit-nrfutil intelhex
```

### Build:

Firstly clone this repo with following commands

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/aroum/nRF52_Bootloader_custom_LED
cd nRF52_Bootloader_custom_LED
git submodule update --init
```

Then build it with `make BOARD={board} all`, for example:

```
make BOARD=feather_nrf52840_express all
```

For the list of supported boards, run `make` without `BOARD=` :

```
$ make
You must provide a BOARD parameter with 'BOARD='
Supported boards are: feather_nrf52840_express feather_nrf52840_express pca10056
Makefile:90: *** BOARD not defined.  Stop
```
Here, {board} matches the name of the configuration folder in `src/boards/{board}`.

The bootloader file can be found here: `_build/build-kabarga/update-kabarga_bootloader-XXX.uf2`

### Common makefile problems

If you get the following error ...

```
lib/sdk11/components/libraries/bootloader_dfu/bootloader_settings.c: In function 'bootloader_mbr_addrs_populate':
lib/sdk11/components/libraries/bootloader_dfu/bootloader_settings.c:45:7: error: array subscript 0 is outside array bounds of 'const uint32_t[0]' {aka 'const long unsigned int[]'} [-Werror=array-bounds=]
45 | if (*(const uint32_t *)MBR_BOOTLOADER_ADDR == 0xFFFFFFFF)
compilation terminated due to -Wfatal-errors.

```
[original issues](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/issues/339)

You are probably using arm-none-eabi-gcc version 14 or higher. You can check it with the following command:

```arm-none-eabi-gcc --version```

If the version is 15 or higher, you need to modify one line in the Makefile. Replace:

```filter 12.% 13.% 14.%,$```

with:

```filter 12.% 13.% 14.% 15.%,$```

Here is an example command to do this automatically:

```
sed -i 's/ifneq (,$(filter 12.% 13.% 14.%,$(shell \$(CC) -dumpversion 2>\/dev\/nul
l)))/ifneq (,$(filter 12.% 13.% 14.% 15.%,$(shell \$(CC) -dumpversion 2>\/dev\/null)))/g' "Makefile"
```
